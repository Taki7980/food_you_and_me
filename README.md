# Project Title

## Description

This project is built using **Next.js 14** with server components. It utilizes **Zustand** for state management, allowing for a simple and efficient way to manage application state. The app fetches data from an API, stores it in a Zustand store, and utilizes that stored data across the application. Some components are created using **ShadCN UI** for a modern and responsive design.

## Why Zustand?

I chose Zustand over Context API and Redux for several reasons:
- **Simplicity**: Zustand provides a straightforward API, making it easier to set up and manage state.
- **Multiple Stores**: It allows for the creation of multiple stores, which helps in organizing state management better.
- **Performance**: Zustand's performance is optimized for React, leading to efficient updates and rendering.

In addition, I wanted to try something new, and after watching a few tutorials, I found Zustand to be much easier for this project compared to other state management tools I've used.

## Health and Delivery Timeline

Due to some health issues, I was not able to deliver the project as quickly as I would have liked. However, I have made every effort to complete the work to the best of my abilities within my current condition. I appreciate your understanding and patience.
